# Forecasting California Unemployment Rates in 2023
This is the final project for the University of San Diegoâ€™s ADS 506 Time Series course. The technical workbook can be found at the [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/nlee98/ADS-506-Time-Series-Analysis).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Introduction and Objective
The preliminary objective of this study is to accurately forecast future unemployment rates in California. From which, the secondary objective was to subjectively deduce the likelihood of a recession occurring in the upcoming year (2023), through the forecasted unemployment rate values. Multiple sources have stated that a recession was likely to occur in 2023. Thus, this study aimed to identify whether unemployment rates, alone, could be indicative of an upcoming recession.

## Project Description
* The [California Unemployment Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CAUR) dataset is provided by Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).
*	The following forecasting methods were assessed for optimality in forecasting unemployment rates in California:
    * Naive Forecast
    * Double-Exponential Smoothing
    * Holt-Winters Method
    * ARIMA
    * ARFIMA
